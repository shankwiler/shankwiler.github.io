<!--
note to self:

- exported from google docs
- added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
- added the nav bar to the top as an absolutely positioned element
- added styles for the nav bar
- removed insane 72pt spacing on the content of the post
- added the following to roughly match the hand written styles on the other blogpost:

        @media only screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
            .c10 {
                max-width: 1000px;
                width: 100%;
                margin: 0 auto;
            }
        }

    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">I wrote the following recap of my experience in a frenzied state immediately after
            the trial. It&rsquo;s long and rambling and not well organized &ndash; so no one should feel any obligation
            to read it all. But it was super interesting, and I had to write down every single detail while it was still
            in my head.</span></p>

    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Prior to walking in the courtroom, I was assigned number 12, which meant I sat in the
            jury box during the questioning portion. There were around 70 or so to start, but 50 or so were included in
            the jury selection after the others were granted exceptions or deferrals right off the bat.<br><br>First,
            the judge asked us to answer questions from a sheet of paper handed out to the group. Answers were given one
            by one, and we each listened to each person respond to each question. Some of the questions were quite
            intimate and sensitive.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were so many heartbreaking experiences:<br></span></p>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_hm69g9ch3y95-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Potential juror 11 a seat away from me explained that his wife
                suffered severe abuse from the daycare she attended as a child. The perpetrator eventually murdered one
                of the kids. To this day, she attends the parole board hearings for the now imprisoned abuser. The
                potential juror explained how painful it is for his wife to relive those memories on a regular
                basis.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Another potential juror revealed that she had been the victim of
                domestic violence, and that she also had been arrested in the same incident. She explained that because
                both she and the other involved party were women, the cops arrested both of them.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Many others had people very close to them who had been abused. For
                some it was a mother, a father, or a friend. Each told the judge that they would try their hardest not
                to let those experiences bias them in either direction. But many were honest and said that it would be
                very difficult.</span></li>

        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One potential juror explained that he has hyperhidrosis, and implied
                that he also has social anxiety and is not accustomed to being in large groups. He was only dismissed
                after answering yes to a question of whether it was possible that he&rsquo;d have trouble standing up
                for his own views during deliberation.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Another guy explained that he had placed bad investments recently
                and was a victim of a ponzi scheme. The trial was ongoing.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One other person explained that his and his girlfriend&rsquo;s
                likenesses were used for an FBI investigation to catch child predators. He was eventually dismissed
                because he continually said that anything involving abuse toward children would totally bias his
                decision on the case because he hates child abusers.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One was a retired cop who was married to a cop. She was eventually
                dismissed. Many others had friends and families who work in law enforcement &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think
                any of them made it on the jury.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Others had past criminal records they recounted to the room of 50 or
                so of us. One guy had a DUI from a couple decades ago. One got caught selling weed in the 80s. I think
                the weed guy made it on the jury.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>After the judge asked questions, the attorneys asked questions too. The questions alternated
            between generic questions that anyone could raise their hands and answer and pointed questions to
            individuals.<br><br>The questions they asked were definitely pertinent to the case, but not always in ways I
            expected. The prosecutor asked the group whether they agreed with the idea that:<br><br>&ldquo;a single
            witness testimony can establish a fact.&rdquo;<br><br>A number of people took issue with the idea, including
            myself. I thought I might be canned because I explained that I&rsquo;ve learned about how unreliable
            people&rsquo;s observational abilities and recollection can be when it comes to details. But I later
            discovered this was likely not a negative indicator for the prosecutor&rsquo;s side, because much of the
            case was dependent on believing one group versus another about their very conflicting explanations of the
            event. Importantly, the wording is &ldquo;</span><span class="c12">can&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;establish a
            fact, not &ldquo;</span><span class="c12">does&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;establish a fact.</span><span
            class="c0"><br><br>Based on a question he asked about whether I collaborate with others at work, I also
            think the attorney was a bit worried I was overly insular, quiet, and non-confrontational as a kind of weird
            computer guy who gave very short answers to the initial questions. He thought I was offended, but really I
            wasn&rsquo;t because that is just how I come across.</span></p>
    <h1 class="c8" id="h.bq5l2ngw7uj5"><span class="c9">The case</span></h1>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The defendant faced two counts:<br></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_9jcmgzcet37d-0 start" start="1">

    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c8" id="h.7x3cm4howjag"><span class="c9">The people in court</span></h1>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_9fmtff8fy64j-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The judge seemed to be quite kindhearted and fair. He didn&rsquo;t
                seem to have a big ego, was of course process-oriented, and took the job very seriously. When ruling on
                an objection made by one of the attorneys he would pause and think deeply before responding.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The bailiff was kind.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The deputy district attorney (prosecutor) was quite young. He seemed
                like a nice guy. He seemed competent but slightly nervous and uncertain, like this may be among the
                first cases he was trying.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defense attorney also was quite young. He seemed like a nice guy
                and my worldviews likely align with his more closely than the prosecutor&rsquo;s. But he also was a bit
                more abrasive than the prosecutor during the trial, and seemed more experienced. The way he communicated
                to the jury was clear and intelligent, but it was hard not to feel like he was telling a story &ndash;
                as his job requires. The prosecutor also was telling a story. But the defense attorney would walk around
                looking at each of us in a more showy fashion, and his tone was more like a salesman.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defendant was a middle aged hispanic man. He was silent during
                the entire trial. He did not look at us. He had headphones on most of the time because a
                Spanish-language translator sat nearby and spoke into a device that connected to his headphones. The
                only time I saw any show of emotion from the defendant was when he covered a smile as one of the
                witnesses was testifying. I don&rsquo;t know what he was smiling about. He may have thought it was funny
                that the witness was either failing to understand the questions or intentionally failing to answer them.
                I also thought it was sort of absurd how poorly some of the witnesses were answering the
                questions.</span></li>

    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The narrative the prosecutor presented, both explicitly during the opening and
            closing arguments and through the lines of questioning, was as follows:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_r0e3absk9h8a-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defendant left the house around 7 PM. He sat in his car drinking
                for hours, which he commonly does.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He re-entered the home at around 9:30 PM, drunk.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">His wife was bathing their seven-year-old son and getting him ready
                for bed. They were in the wife and defendant&rsquo;s bedroom.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The three of them lay down in the bed together.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The husband accused the wife of cheating on him with her coworker,
                Chad.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She denied the claim.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He called her a &ldquo;puta.&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He started pushing her, yelling &ldquo;get out!&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He pushed her two times by the back of the head. She was trying to
                leave the room as he was pushing her.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_r0e3absk9h8a-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Side note: it seemed to most of the jurors during deliberation
                that there possibly were more than two pushes, based on all the testimony. I think the prosecutor needs
                to be careful when giving the story so as to not indicate any doubt, and giving a plausible and
                conservative answer of &ldquo;two&rdquo; was reasonable.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_r0e3absk9h8a-0" start="10">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The seven-year-old son ran out of the bedroom.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">On one of the pushes, she slammed into a &ldquo;case of water
                bottles&rdquo; or a &ldquo;bag of empty water bottles to be recycled.&rdquo; This loud noise prompted
                their young-adult daughter to come out of her room and call 911.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Eventually, he pushed her out of their room into the living
                room.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The sister of the defendant, who also lives in the same house, came
                out of her room and either pushed the defendant back into the bedroom or went in the room and slapped
                him.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">On the 911 call, the daughter said &ldquo;my dad is abusing my
                mom.&rdquo; In response to the question of &ldquo;did he hit her&rdquo; she said &ldquo;Yes. He was [or
                will].&rdquo; Others in the background were yelling that someone needed to call the police.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_r0e3absk9h8a-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Side note: the jury had the audio from this call as evidence. We
                listened to it many times. Information came out of that call that the attorneys didn&rsquo;t discuss.
                One point was that we heard a woman crying out in Spanish in the background saying something to the
                effect of &ldquo;why did my husband hit me&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in pain.&rdquo;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_r0e3absk9h8a-0" start="15">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The police showed up, and took statements from the wife (victim),
                daughter, and sister of the defendant. Their statements were all consistent with the above

    </ol>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Separately, there was another incident in 2019, in which the cops were called to the
            home. Usually, I don&rsquo;t believe this sort of history can be included in a trial, but specifically for
            domestic violence cases there is an allowance for &ldquo;evidence of uncharged domestic violence&rdquo; in
            the past. The story the prosecutor would like us to believe for this 2019 incident is as follows:<br></span>

                and photos from his phone as evidence.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">They had a verbal argument.</span></li>

        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">While she was attempting to leave the room, after she slapped him,
                he grabbed her by the neck or upper chest area with his arm or hand, and slammed her to the

    </ol>
    <h1 class="c8" id="h.6vo2fwml5510"><span class="c9">The defense attorney&rsquo;s story</span></h1>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The narrative from the defense attorney for the 2024 incident being tried, similarly
            provided through his direct arguments and his lines of questioning, was as follows:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_fe4es3la1afh-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defendant left the house around 7 PM. He was going to go get
                medicine for himself, or just drink &ndash; it&rsquo;s not clear.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He came back into the house around 9:30 PM.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The wife and son were in the bedroom, but the son left prior to the
                defendant entering, in order to go say his nightly prayers with others in the living room.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">When the defendant entered the bedroom, the wife was angry at him
                for drinking.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She slapped him.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In order to protect himself and diffuse the situation, he then
                gently held her shoulders and &ldquo;guided&rdquo; her out of the room.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">While &ldquo;guiding&rdquo; her out of the room, she brushed against
                the bag of plastic water bottles accidentally and they fell.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The daughter called 911, mostly because she was worried that her mom
                might fall since she had recently had gallbladder surgery. She wasn&rsquo;t worried about her dad
                hurting her.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The reason the daughter used the words &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;hit&rdquo; was because her emotions were high, and her first language is Spanish so she
                doesn&rsquo;t always translate English to Spanish correctly in her head.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_fe4es3la1afh-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Side note: the point about her language abilities was incredibly
                difficult to believe. She spoke in flawless English without a hint of an accent while on the
                stand.</span></li>

        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The translators who were taking the statements of the residents that
                night confused the residents and were trying to trick them. This included the standard language
                translation phone line which is used across the county for many services, not just the police.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The cops encouraged the residents to tell the story in a certain
                way. The cops don&rsquo;t believe that men can be victims of domestic violence.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Someone from the DA&rsquo;s office approached the victim at a court
                hearing months before the trial, encouraging her to describe her husband as dangerous. She didn&rsquo;t
                agree with that assessment.</span></li>

    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The narrative from the 2019 incident is similar to the prosecutor&rsquo;s narrative,

        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Both of the above points, I believe, came from a Miranda statement
                made by the defendant (of the 2024 case i.e. the husband), and I don&rsquo;t believe they matched up
                with her statement.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_av18lqp2ymwi-0">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I wish there was more to say about the wife&rsquo;s testimony, but
                the story really is just that it was incredibly incongruous with the 911 call which we later heard, the
                answers were very unclear to almost every question about what she told the police, and she said that she
                was the instigator. Importantly, she was adamant that there was no argument about infidelity. She
                started the argument because he was drunk, and he was not an instigator.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_xupyajm7aqnf-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The daughter was 21 years old.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She spoke perfect English and did not require a translator.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Her testimony was very clear and not obstructive in the way her
                mom&rsquo;s was, as described above, but much of it came across as deliberately misleading or outright
                lies.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She had lots of negative things to say about her mom.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Her mom nags, and she doesn&rsquo;t know when to stop an
                argument.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Her mom is a little woman. Her dad is strong. If he wanted to hurt
                her he easily could have.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The push that she had described seeing to the police was actually
                more like gentle guiding out of the room.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She wasn&rsquo;t worried about her dad hurting her mom. She was just
                worried about her mom potentially falling and getting hurt because of the recent surgery.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_xupyajm7aqnf-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Side note: I found this in particular absolutely ludicrous. Why
                are you worried about your mom falling? What or who would be causing her to fall? Let alone the fact
                that on the 911 call which the jury heard played back, the first thing she said was &ldquo;hello my dad
                is abusing my mom.&rdquo;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_xupyajm7aqnf-0">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She did agree that her aunt (the defendant&rsquo;s sister) came in
                the room after the altercation and pushed or slapped the defendant. I don&rsquo;t believe the wife
                brought this up in her testimony.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I believe she did say that her dad was visibly drunk.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She said that her dad had never hit her or her mom.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Overall, I found the daughter&rsquo;s testimony to be completely uncredible. Her
            statements on the stand compared with the 911 call with her voice were so incongruous that it was just
            absurd. She had so many negative things to say about her nagging annoying mom who was bothering her strong
            cool dad. I just found it pretty gross to listen to. Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t let my reaction to her
            language about her mom influence my decision &ndash; that is a side note I&rsquo;m making now. But I could
            choose how much of each testimony to believe based on how credible it appeared to be (based on all the other
            evidence). And the daughter&rsquo;s testimony was clearly not credible.</span></p>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_jcbaree64623-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The 911 call was introduced as evidence while the daughter was on
                the stand.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">We also had access to this audio recording during deliberation, and
                we played it many times.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">During the trial, we were given a transcript, but it wasn&rsquo;t
                the best and didn&rsquo;t capture a lot of the background noise.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The general vibe of the call is utter chaos. Multiple voices are
                wailing in the background. There are multiple people calling out &ldquo;call 911&rdquo; and &ldquo;call
                the police.&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">As previously mentioned, there was Spanish spoken in the background
                that indicated the wife was crying aloud saying that her husband hit her and that she was in pain. That
                was not discussed in the trial at all and it&rsquo;s not clear that the attorneys even knew about this
                detail.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The following key phrases were mentioned:</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_jcbaree64623-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My dad is abusing my mom.&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;[Operator:] Did he hit her?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes. He was
                [or will &ndash; a bit hard to hear].&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He tried to throw her to the floor.&rdquo;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_jcbaree64623-0">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The call ended without the daughter ending it. The operator was
                confused as seemingly the daughter just hung up. Again, the situation seemed incredibly chaotic.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_jcbaree64623-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Each time the call was played &ndash; during the trial and during
                the many times in the deliberation room &ndash; there was a clear vibe shift. The audio was
                harrowing.</span></li>

                she had told the police that the wife did.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">It was similarly excruciating to listen to for that reason.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Her story on the stand was that she was in her bedroom the entire
                time. She didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She may have mentioned coming out at one point and then going back
                into her bedroom.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The above is conflicting with the 911 call, the statements made to
                the police from that night, and the testimony that her niece (daughter of the defendant) made on the
                stand. Every other piece of evidence indicated that she not only witnessed the altercation but got
                involved physically.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t remember if she denied pushing the defendant and
                getting between him and his wife. I feel like she did deny that.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She claimed she was just in her bedroom minding her own business
                until eventually the police came and she was like &ldquo;yeah damn IDK what happened,
                weird.&rdquo;</span></li>

                cops in the 2019 incident. I think this had come up previously and had to be stricken from the record
                too. The judge clearly was mad the prosecutor brought it up again. I don&rsquo;t think who called the
                cops in 2019 would have mattered in my decision making, but there must be some rule that its inclusion

                unsavory things all the time. But taking all the evidence together, it was just fairly unreasonable to
                believe that this neutral phone-a-translator service somehow was trying to trick the residents who
                witnessed the incident.</span></li>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_5qvexzo580v9-0">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defense attorney made the claim that the defendant was a victim
                of domestic violence and that he reported this to the police. I believe those reports were the
                statements the defendant made to the police immediately following the 2019 and 2024 incidents.</span>

        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I agree that he was a victim in the 2019 incident based on what
                we heard. But the idea that slamming a small woman to the floor was an appropriate response in order to
                defend himself is silly.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_5qvexzo580v9-0">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defense attorney painted a picture of corrupt cops who
                don&rsquo;t believe men can be victims, and the translators were sketch, and the DA was trying to coerce
                the family. And the victim herself said on the stand that she slapped the defendant in the 2019 and 2024
                incident.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defense is in a cool situation because they can kind of splatter
                doubt around in all sorts of directions and only one needs to stick. In order to convict, the jurors
                must have ruled out all reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime. So just one piece of
                doubt could be the deciding factor.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I think the defense did a good job, and he was very clear. But the
                foundation of what he was working with just left me with the impression that they really didn&rsquo;t
                have a compelling case.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="c8" id="h.d9c6n8f4y29"><span class="c9">My thoughts on the case</span></h1>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">My perspective certainly shifted a bit on various topics during the discussion, but
            my general understanding and conclusion from the case remained constant. So I&rsquo;m going to just lay out
            how I view the case now and how I viewed it before the deliberations as one cohesive narrative.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s look at the first charge &ndash; which really is my focus and was the
            focus of our deliberations.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The judge provided rules to us that were very clear, laid out in plain English. The
            rules around determining if the battery charge was committed was something like the following, where my
            memory isn&rsquo;t perfect but the general idea is roughly correct:<br></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_3l3wd9qbjoa-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A touch was applied to another party in a rude or unkind manner,
                and</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The victim was a spouse or cohabitant, and</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The touch was not in self-defense. In order for it to be self
                defense, the following must all be true:</span></li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_3l3wd9qbjoa-1 start" start="1">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The defendant reasonably felt they were in imminent danger,
                and</span></li>
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A physical response to the danger was necessary in that moment,
                and</span></li>
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Their response did not go beyond what was required to defend
                themself.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Also importantly, the judge clarified that self-defense does not mean that the
            defendant must have retreated instead of standing their ground. They could stand their ground and even
            pursue the assailant until the danger is no longer present.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.s3t2mmo0u3aj"><span class="c5">Point 1</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">With respect to point 1, the instructions from the judge were very clear that even a
            slight touch to clothing &ndash; not even the person&rsquo;s body &ndash; can be battery if it was done in a
            rude or unkind way.<br><br>Now if we look at the evidence, the story according to the residents of the house
            including the victim when they were on the stand during the trial is that there was never an unkind touch.
            There was simply gentle guiding out the door. However, the testimonies they gave on the stand were so
            riddled with inconsistencies and nonsense, as described above, that it is reasonable to place little weight
            on them.<br><br>Based on the 911 call and the statements made the night of the incident, the defendant
            pushed and possibly hit the victim. Besides the clear statements made regarding the push, we also can
            consider the statements about the sister slapping the defendant or pushing him back in the room. One has to
            wonder &ndash; why would the sister be doing this if not in reaction to his aggression toward his
            wife?<br><br>Now let&rsquo;s look at the 2019 case. The judge instructed us that the previous uncharged case
            can be used as evidence that indicates the defendant&rsquo;s proclivity to commit acts of domestic violence
            if we find the most likely scenario is that the previous uncharged offense was committed. That&rsquo;s very
            important &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have to believe it beyond a reasonable doubt &ndash; just that it was most
            likely &ndash; in order for it to inform the 2024 case.<br><br>In the 2019 case, the defendant had grabbed
            the victim by the neck area and pushed her to the ground. And to be fair, that was following her slapping
            him. But there was no doubt raised by him in his statement that he did indeed push her to the ground. So was
            that a necessary act of self-defense? I find it incredibly unlikely. His action went well beyond what was
            required to protect himself. Based on the fact that he was arguing, I think it was done in a rude way. It
            was intentional force on his wife, and it went beyond what was required to defend himself. I think there was
            a greater than 50% chance he committed battery in this case according to the rules above, and therefore can
            use it to inform the decision on the 2024 case.<br><br>In summary, for point 1:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_apjpmnhoz3h7-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Based on the 911 call and statements made the night of the 2024
                incident, he pushed his wife. Don&rsquo;t forget that the daughter on 911 used the word
                &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; and said that he either hit or will hit his wife and pushed her to the floor.
                Also, the Spanish-speaking jurors heard the wife crying out saying her husband hit her and that she was
                in pain.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The pushes were done in a rude or unkind way. Both the daughter and
                the victim reported in their statements to the police that he had called the victim a
                &ldquo;puta.&rdquo; This to me indicates the temperament he had during the pushes was rude or
                unkind.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The family&rsquo;s testimony disagrees with the pushing
                characterization and denies the language around hitting, but that testimony is highly questionable and
                little weight should be given to it. Particularly its inconsistencies with the 911 audio that we could
                play back made it clear the testimony was not trustworthy.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A past incident of domestic violence committed by him was more than
                50% likely to have happened, and indicates a proclivity to commit domestic violence in this case
                too.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Given the evidence we have, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that
                the defendant did push and potentially hit his wife in a rude or unkind way, satisfying point one. No
                reasonable alternative explanation of what happened can be drawn from the evidence.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.t4m6j6hyitsz"><span class="c5">Point 2</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Not worth discussing, the victim and wife are married and live together.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.meycq5oqt3r8"><span class="c5">Point 3</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In order for us to even enter into the discussion of whether the defendant acted in
            self-defense, we first have to establish that the victim attacked the defendant. There is one main piece of
            evidence that the wife attacked him in 2024: her own testimony on the stand. As discussed above, there are
            many reasons to doubt the validity of her entire testimony.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the judge called out in his instructions that we
            can consider whether witnesses have motivations to bend the truth on the stand. She has many motivations:
            it&rsquo;s her husband, they live together, he works and provides income for the family, she doesn&rsquo;t
            want him facing penalties that could tear him away from his job or kids.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now another point could indicate that there&rsquo;s truth to the idea that she hit
            him, besides her testimony: the 2019 case. The judge instructed us that the 2019 case could be used to
            inform our understanding of whether she hit him in 2024 and whether he would need to defend himself with
            potentially greater force than if she had never hit him before (because he has knowledge that she hits, so
            he needs to be sure to protect himself if she does).</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">A third point we can bring up is the photos of the scratches the defendant had on his
            arm. The scratches were real. But according to statements from the night of the incident, his own sister
            slapped or pushed him, and potentially others were involved in pushing him back as well. It&rsquo;s really
            hard to say that those scratches were the result of the wife initiating physical violence.<br><br>So if we
            take together the following:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_fto37s40i20t-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The wife&rsquo;s testimony that she hit him in 2024 (again, just to
                be clear, her testimony is incredibly suspect), and</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">There is more than a 50% chance that she hit him in 2019, and</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">There is evidence that he was scratched by someone</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">we can start believing that yes, she may have hit him. Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t
            put money on the idea that she hit or slapped him. One juror pointed out that in 2019 her statement to the
            police did include information that she hit him. In 2024 it did not. Why would she omit it in 2024 but not
            2019? I think this is sort of bending the rules of working with the evidence provided, and wouldn&rsquo;t
            have run with it during deliberation, but it is interesting to consider after the trial has
            concluded.<br><br>But let&rsquo;s continue with the idea that she hit him, and be generous to the
            defense&rsquo;s case.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.yp5b5v1f9b0h"><span class="c5">Point 3a and 3b</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;re now in a world of assuming that the wife did indeed hit the defendant
            before he began pushing her. If that was the case, would he reasonably believe he was in imminent danger and
            that some physical action was necessary?<br><br>I think the answer is yes. If he was being slapped, he may
            have needed to do something to protect himself. Now, maybe he could retreat instead, but again, the judge
            specified that a retreat is not necessary. Standing your ground is acceptable.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.hd35b0cdyks2"><span class="c5">Point 3c</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">This is really the sticking point, and where deliberations fell apart. Assuming the
            wife did indeed hit the defendant, did his actions go beyond what was necessary?<br><br>I think the answer
            is absolutely yes. We have multiple statements from the residents that night that he pushed the wife, and
            two of them said it was from behind. The wife specifically stated that he pushed her on the back of the
            head. The daughter or sister said specifically that he pushed her out of the room. The characterization the
            daughter gave on the 911 call was that he was abusing the wife and tried pushing her &nbsp;to the floor. She
            also indicated he hit or would hit her in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>I do not believe the daughter would provide these characterizations of his
            actions if he were simply defending himself. The first words out of her mouth were &ldquo;my dad is abusing
            my mom.&rdquo; If he were coolly protecting himself from his violent wife&hellip; how could the daughter so
            drastically misinterpret that situation?</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">And bringing up this point again, according to statements made that night, the sister
            of the defendant decided to &ldquo;help push&rdquo; him back in the bedroom or slap him. I find it very hard
            to believe the defendant was simply trying to protect himself, his sister saw this and decided, &ldquo;woah
            now I need to push him into the room.&rdquo; This also would have required a big misinterpretation of the
            situation on her part if he was just this chill guy protecting himself from his crazed wife, she saw this
            and believed it required her intervention, and then concluded he was the person to go after.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.7hr2sq8wk4d8"><span class="c5">Two plausible explanations</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">There are two plausible explanations of what happened that night:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_h1tl72os43yv-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Explanation one: The defendant started the physical violence, and he
                pushed her as shown by many pieces of evidence.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_h1tl72os43yv-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Boom, in this situation he committed battery. It doesn&rsquo;t
                matter if she later attacked him back in a way that went beyond self-defense. She is not on trial. If he
                attacked her first without a reasonable belief that it was necessary to protect against an imminent
                threat, it&rsquo;s battery. In other words, points 1 and 2 are true, and point 3 is true because the
                self defense clause fails on point 3a.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="c1 lst-kix_h1tl72os43yv-0" start="2">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Explanation two: The defendant did not start the physical violence,
                the wife did by slapping him. He then responded by pushing her repeatedly such that their daughter
                interpreted it as him trying to push her to the floor. Potentially he hit her or gave indications that
                he would.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_h1tl72os43yv-1 start">
        <li class="c3 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In this situation, we have to decide whether the actions met the
                qualifications to be self-defense. Points 3a and 3b are clearly true. But point 3c is not &ndash; the
                force used went way beyond what was necessary to protect himself.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The two explanations are the only ones I see as possible. There are a million strange
            scenarios one could imagine, but those are not reasonable. A juror must believe the crime was committed
            beyond a reasonable doubt, not without 100% certainty, and the judge called this out in his instructions. It
            could have been that nanobots infected their brains the night of the incident and caused them to report
            falsehoods about what they saw, and the daughter played crying and screaming noises from a Youtube video
            while placing the 911 call. But those are not reasonable ideas.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.dfoptucd0jgh"><span class="c5">Aside about the child abuse charge</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_xrl0fnwoj3uu-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The charge of child abuse I don&rsquo;t really want to even get
                into, because: the attorneys did not focus on that charge, we did not focus on it during our
                deliberations, and I am not convinced that child abuse occurred even though I do believe he committed
                battery against his wife.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The only evidence we have of child abuse is the statement from the
                victim on that night that the son had been in the room and ran out while his dad pushed his mom.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s reasonable doubt in my mind that the statement
                perfectly captured the timeline (what if he ran out while they were yelling and not while he was
                pushing?).</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">In order for it to be child abuse, the child&rsquo;s health must
                have been in danger &ndash; which I think would have required him to be in the room with the
                violence.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Some brought up mental health as something that could have been in
                danger even if physical health was not. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think about that.</span></li>

    <h2 class="c7" id="h.u9hys9k42b2h"><span class="c5">The initial vibe</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone was very cordial. People wanted to introduce themselves. I was thinking
            &ldquo;nah let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s wrap this up before EOD and start talking about case details.&rdquo;
            That would have been a massive mistake. It was critical that we feel comfortable with each other before
            moving forward.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">I will note that one juror in particular, the recently retired guy, had mentioned
            during jury selection that he wanted to be on the case. He got his wish. During deliberations he asked if he
            could be the floor person. No objections. But once we started on the discussion, he sort of floundered about
            how we should organize the discussion and other people started filling in with ideas. The professor started
            steering the direction of the conversation. The recently retired guy eventually said it&rsquo;d make sense
            for the professor to take over as the floor person since he was running with the conversation and was
            &ldquo;centrally located&rdquo; at the table. To be honest, I think the recently retired guy (RRG from here
            on) may have had his ego bruised a bit from this.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">My initial impression was that some of the jurors were kind of confused about the
            framework we were working under. One guy said almost as soon as we sat down something to the effect of
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused about what we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing here&rdquo; and indicated he
            wasn&rsquo;t really totally clear on the fact that the prosecutor and defendant were arguing opposing sides
            of the case. Another guy said not too long after starting something like &ldquo;never doubt the spirit of a
            latina woman,&rdquo; which was sort of insane but also hilarious given the situation we were in and the fact
            that three hispanic women were sitting across from him smiling uncomfortably.<br><br>I also thought that
            people were really pretty uneasy about being overly forward with their beliefs about the case. That might
            have been good, but usually I like making my points of view known early on in discussions. I don&rsquo;t
            like the sort of passive aggressive feeling of disagreement with others without being clear about what
            exactly we&rsquo;re disagreeing on.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.kb0vfmqnx2y"><span class="c5">Day one, afternoon deliberations</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The deliberations started in the afternoon and I don&rsquo;t think we made a whole
            lot of progress in refining our views. In this post I laid out the evidence in the bullet points above, but
            during deliberations all we had was the audio from the 911 call, the photos of the scratches, and our
            notebooks from the trial (which were incredibly disorganized).</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">By the end of the day we weren&rsquo;t even sure about whether the statements that
            the cops had recounted included information about the wife slapping the defendant in the 2024 incident. I
            was certain none of the statements from the police included this, and that it was only brought up by the
            wife on the stand. But people were really mixing up the 2019 and 2024 incidents (this was a problem
            throughout all of our deliberations). So we decided we should request to re-listen to or get a transcript
            from the testimonies of the cops who were on the stand in the trial. Even though I didn&rsquo;t really see
            this as necessary, and I was eager to wrap up deliberations, I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt and if
            anything would only push people toward having the (what in my mind was) more accurate recollection of what
            happened that evening fresh in their minds.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.3tzzpuwvu3gn"><span class="c5">Day two, replaying the cops&rsquo; testimonies</span></h2>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>So the next day we met back in the courtroom and sat listening to the portion of
            the trial when the cops were on the stand. Based on the judge&rsquo;s tone and his choice of words I think
            he was kind of annoyed about this, and he didn&rsquo;t want the trial to drag on too long. But as we
            listened to the audio, all I could think was, holy shit this is confusing. Interspersed with all the
            questions and answers, and sometimes in the middle of an answer, the defense attorney would say
            &ldquo;objection&rdquo; and give a reason for the objection. And then the judge would need to think for a
            few seconds and either overrule the objection or sustain it and possibly tell us to strike it from the
            record. Additionally, I realized the 2019 and 2024 incidents were so similar that I didn&rsquo;t really
            blame people for mixing the two up. Also, don&rsquo;t forget, the testimonies the cops were giving were
            about statements that the people involved in the incidents had said to them that night &ndash; a sort of
            indirect route for us to receive information. What I&rsquo;m getting at here is that I think it was totally
            understandable that we needed to listen to this audio over again to get a clear picture of what the cops had
            testified about.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">And I wrote down many details that I had missed when first listening to these
            testimonies. When they first had been on the stand, it was difficult to even know what exactly would be
            relevant. Listening to it again after having started the deliberations, I knew what mattered and what
            didn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.9d970emp5x4t"><span class="c5">Day two, most people don&rsquo;t agree with me</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We left the courtroom to get back to deliberations with a clearer picture of what the
            cops had said. And we all agreed when we got back that we had answered the main uncertainty that we wanted
            to clarify &ndash; there was no information about the wife slapping the defendant that night from any of the
            statements the police took. That piece of information came solely from the wife on the stand during the
            trial.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">At some point shortly after, we went around the table taking turns expressing our
            current thoughts on the case. There were maybe six people before me, and each of them said they were
            uncertain. On my turn, I said that it was very clear to me that the evidence pointed to one conclusion
            &ndash; that he had indeed committed battery on his wife &ndash; and that I had trouble seeing how another
            conclusion was possible. I think it sort of surprised the others that I was very explicit about this. RRG
            (recently retired guy) went next and I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what he said, but I got the sense he
            felt the defendant&rsquo;s actions were self-defense. Of the remaining people to speak, three or four
            (including the attorney) also were leaning toward him being guilty.<br><br>Amazingly to me, an anonymous
            straw poll we took at one point had 5 people voting guilty and 7 not guilty. To be honest I can&rsquo;t
            remember if this was from day two, or the prior afternoon before we had listened to the cops&rsquo;
            testimony again. But either way, the point is there was not consensus.<br><br>We discussed for awhile, and I
            at various points soap boxed and laid out why the evidence in my mind was so clear that the defendant was
            guilty. Others did the same. The tone of our discussion started taking a bad turn when RRG was getting upset
            with the community development manager for seemingly interrupting him. I really did not think she was
            interrupting him. I think there was tension because she was disagreeing with points he was making &ndash;
            and her disagreement was valid. Again, I think already his ego had been a bit bruised when he let go of the
            role of floorperson and now he didn&rsquo;t like feeling like he was being out-argued too.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">At that point I could tell RRG just did not like the community development manager,
            but I didn&rsquo;t want that to mean he would dig in further to his viewpoint. I was trying to be very open
            and make it clear that there weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;sides&rdquo; in the discussion, and that I could see where
            he was coming from. In particular, I said that he was right, the defendant&rsquo;s wife shouldn&rsquo;t have
            slapped him in 2019. I said that we should tell the DA&rsquo;s office after the trial that they should
            prosecute her too. But she wasn&rsquo;t on trial, and it can be true that both she and him committed
            battery. In reality, I think that is a stupid idea &ndash; obviously the DA isn&rsquo;t going to press
            charges on this woman from a 5 year old case in which her husband threw her to the floor. But I do think
            technically they could. My point is that I wanted RRG to feel like we had similar views and just needed to
            get aligned about our conclusions.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.lgbvkey0q8hs"><span class="c5">Day two, almost everyone comes around</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">By the late afternoon, we had spent a lot of time discussing. But a problem was clear
            to me which remained throughout all of our deliberations &ndash; it was really difficult to dig in on
            certain points. The professor and others were adamant that one person speak at a time and that we be very
            careful about not interrupting each other. But what that meant was that people would go on 1-2 minute
            rambles, and then others would speak after with their own 1-2 minute rambles, and it was very difficult to
            counter a specific point made by someone three speakers before you because the context was all lost in
            everyone&rsquo;s minds.<br><br>This case and probably most cases really hinge on certain details, and the
            boolean logic of the rules the judge gave. Diving deep on a line of argument and layering that over the
            rules given by the judge is super tricky, and in a room of strangers, without a chance to really refine our
            thoughts individually and write out a clear argument ahead of time like an attorney would, with scattered
            notes and a lack of sleep from early mornings and a switch to daylight saving time, it&rsquo;s just pretty
            tough.<br><br>That said, after hours of discussion and carefully reading over the judge&rsquo;s
            instructions, eventually it seemed that people were coming around to the view that the defendant was guilty.
            Maybe I just annoyed people enough with my monologues and insistence that the evidence pointed to that as
            the conclusion that they felt forced into that view. Either way, toward the end of the day we took another
            anonymous poll and found that eleven of us believed the defendant was guilty. It was clear that RRG was the
            one holdout.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.se6cvl6epk66"><span class="c5">Day two, giving up</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">At this point, I think people were exhausted. People were starting to feel like this
            was a hung jury. But I thought that was crazy. We spent a week going through this trial, and we had made so
            much progress. So I said that, and I told RRG that I had a friend who convinced eleven others on a jury to
            switch to not guilty on some of the charges of the case he was on. I said we could continue the discussion
            and implied that might happen here too. I really wanted RRG to feel like it was a discussion and we could
            switch either way. In reality at that moment, I felt there was no way I&rsquo;d switch to believing the
            defendant not guilty, and RRG was not good at laying out a clear argument so it probably would have been
            impossible for him to convince me and others with strong views. But he should at least feel like it was
            possible.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Then, after like another half hour of discussion &ndash; I did give up. It felt to me
            that RRG was not really engaging with the discussion. He didn&rsquo;t bring up specific counter-points. He
            didn&rsquo;t have a clear argument as to what others were wrong about.<br><br>Something he said multiple
            times was like &ldquo;you&rsquo;re entitled to your opinion about what happened and I&rsquo;m entitled to
            mine&rdquo; which to me felt like an absolute cop out in terms of constructing a real argument. Like yeah,
            we can have opinions about things, but we need to make an argument based on the evidence we have. What is
            your argument? I&rsquo;ll continue this rant about RRG&rsquo;s thought process later, but at this point I
            was not frustrated but instead just sort of accepting of the situation we were in.<br><br>We threw in the
            towel.<br><br>We sent a note to the judge, he called us back to the court room. He said he were to meet
            again the next morning after he had a chance to talk to the lawyers. I thought it was over, especially
            because the floor person had conveyed to the judge that it was hopeless.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.8q4xdbxxmv40"><span class="c5">Day three, we got better organized</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The judge told us the next day that we were to continue deliberations, and perhaps
            try a different approach during our discussion.<br><br>We decided to go through the exact language of the
            charge, and write down each piece of evidence that related to it. So we did that, very thoroughly and
            methodically. We tried to avoid sprinkling in argumentation while bringing up the evidence. We also decided
            not to doubt the validity of the evidence until later. I should also mention that many people were sort of
            on the fence still. The straw poll from the prior day didn&rsquo;t capture that.<br><br>So we got through
            each of the points except for the last part of the self-defense clause, that the force couldn&rsquo;t go
            beyond what was necessary. We laid out all of the evidence. And without that last clause, it felt like it
            really could be reasonable that the defendant was defending himself. There was the 2019 precedent of her
            slapping him, she said she slapped him in 2024 on the stand, and he had scratches on him. And we
            weren&rsquo;t going into whether all of that evidence was legit yet. And the excessive force part was so
            important!<br><br>I did not attempt to argue anything at this point. I knew that the excessive force part
            really was key, and questioning the validity of some of the evidence was also key. But we took a poll before
            we got to that point, and it was something like 8 guilty, 4 not guilty. Kind of disheartening, but I knew
            things would get cleared up later. The bailiff asked if we wanted to continue, and I said something to the
            effect of &ldquo;I think the evidence is so clear, I don&rsquo;t know how it would be possible for people
            not to change their mind&rdquo; which probably wasn&rsquo;t helpful. We broke for lunch, planning to come
            back later.<br><br>When we came back, we were able to dive into the excessive force point. And I also
            brought up how ridiculous the testimony from the family on the stand was. The idea that the defendant was
            gently &ldquo;guiding&rdquo; his wife out of the room was in direct contradiction to the 911 call. We
            listened to the 911 call again. We read more of the judge&rsquo;s instructions &ndash; including very
            importantly that we could choose to question and disregard some of the testimony on the stand.<br><br>This
            point from the judge&rsquo;s rules he gave to us that we could question the testimony given on the stand was
            really important to some people. I think it allowed them to see that the family&rsquo;s story just
            wasn&rsquo;t something we could take seriously given its inconsistency. RRG said &ldquo;well by questioning
            their statements on the stand you&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re committing a felony by lying under
            oath.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip; yeah dude people lie under oath all the time. In particular it
            wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising for a wife to lie to protect her husband.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.ercva64gh717"><span class="c5"><br>Day three, really giving up</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>So after the above organized discussion and clear breakdown of the evidence, we took another
            anonymous poll. Again, it was 11 guilty 1 not guilty. RRG had not been swayed.<br><br>We continued
            discussing, but I started really internalizing that this dude was not going to have his mind swayed. I also
            started feeling frustrated in a way I had not previously.<br><br>Mostly, I think it&rsquo;s pretty bad to
            try to argue with people in a way where you pick apart their points in a pointed manner. Like if someone
            says &ldquo;it rains more in March than December&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not great to immediately point at them
            and say &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wrong the data says otherwise see right here&rdquo; because it feels like an
            attack against them personally. It&rsquo;s better to wait a minute and then be like &ldquo;you know actually
            it&rsquo;s kind of surprising but I looked up some information from NOAA and it rains more in
            December.&rdquo;<br><br>But a jury is a unique situation &ndash; you won&rsquo;t see these people again, it
            doesn&rsquo;t matter too much what you all think of each other, you just need to get to a decision and
            dip.<br><br>So I sort of regret not calling out RRG&rsquo;s bad points specifically. I did at various points
            &ndash; one time I think it had to do with the evidence we had about the wife slapping the defendant in
            2024, and he just backed down. It was kind of uncomfortable to just call out this dude. But it might have
            worked as a last ditch effort. I could have just crashed out and told RRG he needed to explain his line of
            thought. And then pick apart where he was wrong.<br><br>Even the attorney on our jury never really called
            out RRG specifically. More just like &ldquo;well the not-guilty-view is wrong because XYZ.&rdquo; But I do
            kind of wish we had been like &ldquo;RRG, you are the one holdout, you need to explain how we&rsquo;re
            wrong.&rdquo;<br><br>It felt like we were in </span><span class="c15"><a class="c17"

    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Toward the end of day three, others and RRG had a conversation that went something
            like the above and I became incredibly frustrated. The dude just wasn&rsquo;t making sense and I felt that
            his pride and ego prevented him from thinking clearly.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c7" id="h.evjlcw4ba6ac"><span class="c5">Day three, it&rsquo;s over</span></h2>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We gave up. The judge declared a mistrial due to hung jury. Before leaving the
            deliberation room, people were saying things like &ldquo;oh no RRG, it&rsquo;s all good, people can have
            different views, blah blah.&rdquo; Honestly I don&rsquo;t agree. I don&rsquo;t think we have to feel good
            about what happened, and I don&rsquo;t think we have to believe that RRG was acting in good faith or being
            reasonable.<br><br>I think RRG screwed up the trial and was not a clear thinker. I think he was bad at
            articulating his view, and I think he was bad at it because his view was wrong. I don&rsquo;t think he
            considered the evidence and jury instructions deeply. I don&rsquo;t think he was willing to have his mind
            changed. I don&rsquo;t think he even tried to change our minds.</span></p>
    <h1 class="c8" id="h.hg80iqxrfi1i"><span class="c9">Closing thoughts</span></h1>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0"><br>I wrote the above in a sort of frantic state after the trial concluded. At the
            time, I was very frustrated with the outcome. I felt quite strongly that the one holdout was being totally
            unreasonable and was not able to provide a coherent narrative for his view. That said, the prosecutor did
            not have a slam dunk case. I don&rsquo;t think he realized how much it hurt his argument that he brought up
            the wife hitting her husband in a past case. That led all sorts of speculation about her being an aggressor
            in the 2024 case. He seemed surprised by this when I talked to him, which was really odd to me.<br><br>I do
            want to add a conciliatory note for the holdout I was railing against above. It&rsquo;s hard trying to
            understand what actually happened that night &ndash; you have smart people on both sides weaving narratives
            that contradict each other while they&rsquo;re seemingly earnestly compelling you to believe them. It
            wasn&rsquo;t until the last couple days in the trial that I really felt like I was getting the full
            picture.<br><br>I&rsquo;m curious whether the DA&rsquo;s office will choose to re-try the case, and how it
            would play out the second time around. The part that&rsquo;s really sad is that I think the family will be
            far less likely to call the cops if the guy is abusive in the future. Particularly if anyone in the family
            has an uncertain immigration status, they&rsquo;re going to have a really high bar for getting cops involved
            again.<br><br>I don&rsquo;t have any great takeaways, but it was an incredibly interesting
            experience.</span></p>

    <ul class="c1 lst-kix_ex2hxy3lkzuk-0 start">
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a cliche that it&rsquo;s really difficult to leave an
                (alleged) abuser &ndash; but I really get why. The couple has been together long enough to have adult
                children. A network of extended family all live together, each with close ties to the defendant.
                They&rsquo;re likely dependent on him financially.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">There were all sorts of interesting dynamics &ndash; immigrant
                family vs cops, the daughter painting her mom in a bad light to defend her dad, the defense attorney
                lambasting the wife calling her an abuser while also telling us to trust her testimony on the
                stand.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The process was very laborious. Everything took a very long time
                &ndash; and for good reason really. Probably there are some process improvements that could be made, but
                generally I think trials are necessarily long-running. I can see why many cases end in a plea deal
                before getting to trial &ndash; there&rsquo;s a strong incentive to just avoid the whole mess.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">It made me realize how different my job is from many others. The
                idea of &ldquo;work&rdquo; for a judge or an attorney or a clerk is just so different from my conception
                of it.</span></li>
        <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Although I didn&rsquo;t agree with the outcome of this case,
                I&rsquo;m really glad the system errs on the side of innocence for the accused.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m glad I was on a jury, and I&rsquo;m open to doing it again sometime in the
            distant future. I&rsquo;ll think back about that family and the case and our deliberations and the entire
            process for the rest of my life.</span></p>
